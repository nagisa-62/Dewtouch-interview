Dear Staff,

The below is my approach to answer the question.

Q1. Record model has relation with RecordItems.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It's a bottleneck to read this page, so added recursive -1.

Q2. Use tipper plug-in on bootstrap instead of dialog.

Q3. Inplements input fields and inserting row button with Jquery.

Q4. Inplements File upload and mime type check.

Q5. Inplements creating OrderReport on OrderReportController.

Q6. Inplements migration tool from excel file with PhpSpreadSheet.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Firstly, please install PhpSpreadSheet with composer. (composer.json is in root folder)
